    <br><br>Hi, I am Jianan Xu. I am an undergraduate student studying General Engineering(specialization: Computer Science) in the Technical University of Denmark(<a href="https://www.dtu.dk">DTU</a>). This is Jianan's blog, which records my life and study. Enthusiasm for life and thirst for knowlwdge are "nourishment" for my growth, just as sunshine and water are vital for the growth of plants. I will spare no effort to cultivate my "sprout" here, let it grow strong.

## :file_folder: Projects

* **Assisted-Driving System with Multi-sensor Fusion and Computer Vision** 

  Nov. 2019 - Apr. 2020 

  Python, C++, OpenCV, YOLOv3, MQTT, Raspberry Pi 4B

  This research project headed by Nanjing Institute of Technology, School of Computer Engineering. This project aimed to combine lidar, infrared IR sensor and computer vision to detect potential risks in front of the car in real time while driving, and guides the car to take certain actions when encountering danger. This includes car model and software implementation. Three parts are implemented for the system - car controller, detection server, and an expandable collision avoidance system. 

* **Deep Learning for Autonomous Perception in Visual Guided Navigation** 

  Oct. 2021 - Feb. 2022
  
  Python, OpenCV, YOLOv5, Docker, ROS, Ubuntu, NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX
  
  This project is a part of the research project [Inspectrone](https://www.dtu.dk/english/news/Nyhed?id=%7BF8B2908E-FAC2-48AB-A1A5-060839E880C8%7D), which is headed by DTU Electrical Engineering. This project aimed to develop a deep learning-based lightweight embedded navigation system to navigate a drone through the entrance to the cabin. The main tasks were to create datasets, train real-time object detection models and then deploy the whole detection system on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX. 
  
* **Exploring the applications of AI-based computer vision in digital microfluidic biochips**

  Jan. 2022 - Now

  This research project is headed by DTU Mathematics and Computer Science. This project aims to explore the possible applications of AI-based computer vision in the context of digital microfluidic biochips. This includes the detection of droplets, bubbles, hands, pipettes, shadows, and other visual interference sources. The main tasks are to set up the AI environment/framework, produce the training samples, develop the necessary software infrastructure for video input/output and video pre- and post-processing. Finally, design and run experiments to demonstrate the correct functionality of the developed techniques.
